## Introduction

`0x92fBA9067844A419A1C394197aE406768555F71b`

The EKOKE ERC20 token is the main token of the DAO and it's used both as a reward for third party investors for buying the Deferred NFTs and as a store of value.

It's capability of being a store of value is given by the fact that EKOKE tokens are scarce and the amount of minted tokens will decrease quickly in the range of a decade.

## Tokenomics

The token has total maximum supply of `8_880_101_010_000_000` which is **8,880,101.010000000 tokens with 9 decimals**.

At the creation of the contract the tokens minted will be 0, but tokens can be created both by the contract owner and the [Reward Pool](./RewardPool.md).

The reward pool will mint up to the 66.6% of the total supply (`5_920_067_340_000_000`) using the algorithm described in [the reward document](../reward.md); while the remaining 33.3% will be minted by the owners according to this schema:
