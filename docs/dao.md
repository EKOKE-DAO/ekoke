# EKOKE DAO

The EKOKE projects is launched as a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). The reason of that is that we want
EKOKE to be an autonomous project, where everybody can contribute to the development of the projects. Let's see how and who can contribute.

## Contributions

There are many way each actor can contribute to the EKOKE DAO:

- **Developers**: Developers can contribute by improving the code of the EKOKE DAO project through the Github repositories. Our codebase is 100% open-source and everybody is welcome to contribute to it.
- **Real estate agencies**: Real estate agencies are invited to join EKOKE DAO to start proposing properties to be sold on our infrastructure. Real estate agencies must submit a registration form and must then be approved by the DAO to be approved. Once real estate agencies are approved they will receive a reward in EKOKE tokens for joining.
- **Real estate properties sellers**: People who wants to sell their real estate properties are welcome to opt for using EKOKE as their media to sell their properties. Sellers are awarded by agencies with rewards if they sell their property on EKOKE. You can refer to our [Partner agencies page](https://ekokedao.com/agencies) if you need to find agencies.
- **Real estate seekers**: Whoever wants to seek for a house without paying huge amounts of mortgage interests with the traditional bank system, can join EKOKE to seek for a property and opt for paying with installments with a low fixed-rate interest rate.
- **Community**: The EKOKE community can contribute in two very simple ways:
  - **Buy Deferred Tokens**: The community main purpose is actually to buy Deferred tokens on the [EKOKE DAO Marketplace](https://ekokedao.com/marketplace).
  - **Voting** The DAO will give everyone the right to vote. Voting will allow everyone to choose for these kind of things:
    - **Real-estate agencies submission**: the submission of an agency in the DAO will go through voting on the DAO.
    - **New feature Pull requests**: Pull requests which introduce major changes and new features to the DAO will be voted.
    - **Refunds for frauds**: In case of frauds, the DAO will vote to approve withdrawal from the **Liquidity Pool** to refund frauded investors.

## How and Where the DAO will be managed

We plan to launch the DAO on the [Internet Computer NNS](https://nns.ic0.app/) in Q3/Q4 of 2025. Unfortunately we'll have to wait a couple of months since NNS requirements have recently become more restrictive their standards to accept new organizations.

### Why NNS

NNS is just great to handle DAO governance. Voting is great, it's cheap and it's easy to use.

### Will there be a new token?

Yes, we're going to use a **EKOGOV** token for governance which will be used just for partecipating in the DAO. We'll never withdraw it for economic returns, since we don't want to pollute the DAO.

### What if it gets rejected?

In case we get rejected we'll just deploy the DAO somewhere else. It may be on Internet Computer or on Ethereum, we'll see. Anyway no matter the platform, the purpose of the DAO won't change.
